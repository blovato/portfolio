I'm a front-end developer with over 9 years of experience building thoughtful, high-quality interfaces in React and TypeScript. I specialize in bringing designs to life through robust component libraries, interactive dashboards, and seamless UI systems.

I gravitate toward projects that contribute to something meaningful in the world. Whether it's building tools for social good or helping purpose-driven teams move their mission forward, I enjoy working with people who care about what they're creating.

I live on a small farm in the Santa Cruz mountains with my sister and her family, where I balance my work with surfing, yoga, and a dedicated meditation practice. I'm also training as a somatic coach â€” a path that deepens my commitment to presence, listening, and authentic collaboration.

I thrive in fluid, interdependent teams where design, engineering, and product come together around a shared vision. If you're looking for a front-end partner who brings depth, thoughtfulness, and reliability to your project, I'd love to connect.
